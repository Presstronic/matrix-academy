## ✨ Overview

**Matrix Academy** is an interactive learning platform where developers sharpen their craft by navigating a branching, story‑driven adventure.
Rather than endless tutorials, every decision you make impacts your path—combining hands‑on coding, narrative challenges, and progression milestones.

> This document is intentionally lightweight and will expand as functionality lands.
